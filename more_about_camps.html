          <p>Situated on the most southerly fjord in North America, Porteau Cove Provincial Park features waterfront campsites with a view over Howe Sound to the mountains beyond. An old ship has been sunk to provide interest for Scuba divers and to attract marine life. There are special facilities for divers. Adjacent train tracks are active and occasional noise disturbance may occur.<br>
          Only 45 minute drive north of Vancouver, enjoy the experience of ocean front camping at Porteau Cove. Day-use area offers picnic sites in a grassy area along the shore. Porteau Cove is also accessible by water; a mooring float (with no shore access) is located at the south end of the park. Porteau Cove is a popular area for stargazing and scuba diving, with a man-made reef and 2 sunken vessels. Ice, firewood and concessionary items are available for sale at the gatehouse.<br>
            The park is 50 hectares in size, and offers picnicing, camping, swimming, windsurfing, and a boat launch. Porteau Cove is a very popular area for scuba diving, with a series of artificial reefs including two sunken vessels. It has 44 drive-in campsites and 16 walk-in sites. 80% of the campsite may be reserved through Discover Camping, April through September. The park is maintained and operated by Sea To Sky Parks, based in Mount Seymour in North Vancouver, BC.<br>On July 29, 2008, a large rockslide took place at the Porteau Bluffs, just north of Porteau Cove. No one was injured, however access to Whistler was hampered.[1] The highway and the rail line run tightly together at the base of the bluffs, which is composed of slab-like chunks of granite, which formerly overhung the highway until scaling reduced some of the mass of the bluff. The slide has renewed concerns about the geotechnical safety of the route, and was a security issue during the 2010 Olympics events in Whistler. Communities north of the slide, including Whistler, are often isolated by such slides, but a "back door" paved route exists via Lillooet and the Fraser Canyon.</p>

        <p>Hicks Lake is located in Sasquatch Provincial Park and there is a campground right next to the lake. The Hicks Lake campsite features spots for tenters, pull-in sites for RVers, each with access to picnic tables, fire pits, and toilet facilities. There are also other campgrounds at nearby lakes, including Bench Campground and Lakeside (Deer Lake) Campground. Opening times vary for each campsite but generally the campsites are open from spring to early-fall.<br>Located north of Harrison Hot Springs, Sasquatch Provincial Park is characterized by a series of pocket lakes, a unique second-growth and birch forest, and scenic mountain ridges.

          Hicks and Deer Lakes are ideal for motor-boating and canoeing while Trout Lake provides a tranquil fishing experience. Visitors can also enjoy camping, hiking, wildlife viewing, and picnicking.<br>
        The park was established 1968, in its present condition. It actually began in 1959 as a 20 hectare inland fjord called Green Point Park, which was expanded into a picnicking area in 1960. Eight years later the park was expanded greatly and renamed. It was named after Sasquatch (a Halkomelem Salish word), the cryptid said to be endemic to the area.<br>
          The park is 1217 hectares in size. It is characterized by a series of pocket lakes, a unique second-growth and birch forest, and scenic mountain ridges.<br>
          The hiking trail around Hicks Lake in Sasquatch Provincial Park offers a nice, peaceful loop that passes along the lake shores, over several small streams, and returns via a gravel road. The route offers a few scenic viewpoints of the lake and joins several of the picnic, beach, and campsite areas.<br>
          From the boat launch in the day-use area, the trail starts on the right from the sandy beach. Follow the trail as it weaves along the shoreline. A short distance along the route, the trail opens next to a rocky outcrop that overlooks a scenic view of the lake. After a quick stop, walk back onto the trail and continue as it makes its way down to one of the picnic beach area.

After passing over a metal bridge, immediately go left and follow the route along the lake beach. It may look like the trail goes to the right but that route just goes to the campsite area. Continue along the trail as it weaves through the forest and arrives at another picnic area. This time, the trail enters back into the forest just up from the beach area. This is the last picnic area as you begin to walk away from the camping area.

The next section of trail makes its way through the forest, with short uphill and downhill sections, small bridges crossing streams, and the occasional glimpses of Hicks Lake. It's a scenic section of trail that can often be a bit muddy during the winter months. There are more than a dozen small wooden bridges and in the late spring, most of these creeks are rushing with water from the melting snow on the nearby mountains.

The trail eventually ends up joining a gravel road. At this point, the decision can be made to walk along the gravel road to loop back to the start or return to the day-use area along the same trail you arrived by. The gravel road does not offer many scenic points but is a quicker route due to its flatness, despite having to loop around more than half the lake still. If returning via the gravel road, note that the kilometre markers refer to the turnoff to Hicks Lake and not to the start of the hiking trail. You can expect that the parking lot will end up around the 2.5km mark at the day-use area where you started.

        <p>E.C. Manning Provincial Park is a provincial park in British Columbia, Canada. It is usually referred to as Manning Park, although that nomenclature is also used to refer to the resort and ski area at the park's core. The park is 70,844 hectares (273.53 square miles).<br>
          The earliest human use of the land was by the coastal native peoples of British Columbia who, by travelling the route of the present day Skyline Trail accessed the Upper Similkameen Valley. The first European in the area was 1813 and was explored and mapped in 1827 by Archibald McDonald. Access to the area prior to the Great Depression was extremely limited due to a lack of any kind of developed roads or trails over the Cascade Mountains (other than the Dewdney Trail, far to the North). In 1929, the construction of a Road through the area was begun as a work project for the unemployed, but did not get completed. When the Canadian government began the internment of Japanese Canadians following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, one camp was formed in the present day Sunshine Valley, and the workers built the current Hope-Princeton highway, which was completed in 1949. The current route of the Hope-Princeton highway follows the route of the Allison Pass Trail, which was constructed in 1859-1860. The approximate route of the current Hope-Princeton highway was considered by the Great Northern Railroad, which led to much land being purchased along the predicted route prior to the formation of the park. The earliest form of the park was established in 1931 as the Three Brothers Mountain Reserve to prevent overgrazing, and eventually this became the three brothers game reserve in 1936. In 1941, the park was formed as Three Brothers Mountain Park, a Class A Provincial Park.<br>
          The park was soon thereafter named in memory of Ernest Callaway Manning, Chief Forester of British Columbia from 1936 to 1941 (not to be confused with Ernest C. Manning, Premier of Alberta from 1943 to 1968). Mr. Manning was killed in an airplane accident in 1941. During his time as Chief Forester he was instrumental in developing the idea of setting land aside for future generations to enjoy. It was the teamwork of Manning and Arthur Wellesley Gray, Minister of Lands from 1933 to 1944, that established Tweedsmuir Provincial Park, Hamber Provincial Park, Wells Gray Provincial Park, and E.C. Manning Provincial Park.[2] Over the years, Manning Park has decreased in size, the most noticeable change being the park boundary in the east. Originally, the park included Similkameen Falls, but due to mine claims and private land ownership, the boundaries have since been moved more than four kilometers west.<br>
          The park has a wide range of walking and hiking trails which range anywhere from a 15-minute walk to a 5 or 6 day hike. Lightning Lake is often used for non-motorized watersports, such as canoeing, kayaking, and fishing.
